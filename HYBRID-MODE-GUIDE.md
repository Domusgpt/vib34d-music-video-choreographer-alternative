# üé¨üéß HYBRID MODE GUIDE

## What You Got - THE COMPLETE SYSTEM

Your VIB34D Music Video Choreographer now has **BOTH working together**:

### **üé¨ Choreographed Timeline**
- Control WHEN things happen (exact timing)
- Program system switches (Faceted ‚Üí Quantum ‚Üí Holographic)
- Set geometry changes (cycle, morph, random, explosive)
- Design rotation patterns (smooth, chaos, extreme)
- Define color sequences (freeze, slow, rainbow)

### **üéß Audio Reactivity** (ALWAYS ACTIVE)
- Bass frequencies boost grid density
- Mid frequencies drive morphing
- High frequencies add chaos
- Energy controls speed and intensity
- Beat detection triggers visual pulses

## How It Works Together

**Choreography sets BASE VALUES**
‚Üì
**Audio MODULATES in real-time**
‚Üì
**Result: Planned sequences that react to music**

### Example from Default Choreography:

```
0-15s: Faceted System
‚îú‚îÄ Base: Smooth rotation, 0.1 chaos, 0.5 speed
‚îî‚îÄ Audio: Bass adds density, mid adds morph, energy boosts speed

30-50s: SWITCH TO QUANTUM (choreographed)
‚îú‚îÄ Base: Chaos rotation, 0.8 chaos, 2.0 speed
‚îî‚îÄ Audio: Bass intensifies patterns, high frequencies add complexity

50-60s: SWITCH TO HOLOGRAPHIC (choreographed)
‚îú‚îÄ Base: Extreme rotation, 0.9 chaos, 2.5 speed
‚îî‚îÄ Audio: Maximum reactivity, rainbow colors pulse with bass
```

## Default Choreography Breakdown

**Sequence 1 (0-15s)**: Faceted Intro
- System: üî∑ Faceted
- Geometry: Cycling through shapes
- Audio modulates: All parameters reactive

**Sequence 2 (15-30s)**: Faceted Build
- System: üî∑ Faceted (stays)
- Geometry: Morphing
- Audio modulates: Increasing responsiveness

**Sequence 3 (30-50s)**: Quantum Drop
- System: üåå QUANTUM (switches!)
- Geometry: Random changes on high energy
- Audio modulates: Chaos patterns with frequencies

**Sequence 4 (50-60s)**: Holographic Peak
- System: ‚ú® HOLOGRAPHIC (switches!)
- Geometry: Explosive random
- Audio modulates: Maximum reactivity

**Sequence 5 (60-75s)**: Faceted Breakdown
- System: üî∑ Faceted (switches back!)
- Geometry: Hold current
- Audio modulates: Minimal but still reactive

**Sequence 6 (75s+)**: Quantum Final Drop
- System: üåå QUANTUM (switches!)
- Geometry: Explosive chaos
- Audio modulates: Everything maxed out

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ BOTH Modes Do This:
- Real-time beat detection
- BPM estimation
- Bass/Mid/High frequency analysis
- Visual beat indicators
- Timeline scrubbing
- Mobile optimized

### üéß Reactive Mode Only:
- Pure audio control
- No timeline editor
- Simple parameter mapping

### üé¨ Hybrid Mode Adds:
- Timeline editor with sequence list
- System switching choreography
- Programmable geometry changes
- Exportable/importable JSON
- Base values + audio overlay

## Timeline Editor Controls

**For Each Sequence:**
- **Start Time**: When it begins (seconds)
- **Duration**: How long it lasts (seconds)
- **System**: Which renderer (Faceted/Quantum/Holographic)
- **Geometry**: Shape behavior (hold/cycle/morph/random/explosive)
- **Rotation**: 4D pattern (minimal/smooth/accelerate/chaos/extreme)
- **Chaos Base**: Starting chaos level (0-1)
- **Speed Base**: Starting speed (0.1-3.0)
- **Color Shift**: Hue change rate (freeze/slow/medium/fast/rainbow)

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Note**: These are BASE values. Audio ALWAYS modulates on top!

## Audio Reactivity Formula

```
Final Value = Base (from sequence) + Audio Modulation

Examples:
- Chaos = 0.5 (base) + 0.4 * energy (audio)
- Speed = 1.0 (base) * (1 + 0.6 * energy) (audio multiplier)
- GridDensity = 15 (base) + 35 * bass (audio boost)
- Hue = timeline pattern + frequency modulation
```

## System Switching Magic

**Choreography controls WHEN systems switch:**
```javascript
30s: Switch from Faceted to Quantum
50s: Switch from Quantum to Holographic
60s: Switch back to Faceted
75s: Switch to Quantum for finale
```

**Audio reactivity works IN EVERY SYSTEM:**
- Faceted: Precise geometric audio response
- Quantum: Lattice patterns pulse with frequencies
- Holographic: Maximum audio sensitivity

## How to Use on Mobile

1. **Visit**: `https://domusgpt.github.io/vib34d-music-video-choreographer/`
2. **Choose**: üé¨ HYBRID MODE
3. **Load**: Your audio file
4. **Optional**: Edit sequences in timeline editor
5. **Play**: Watch choreography + reactivity work together
6. **Export**: Save your choreography as JSON

## Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
- **Start with default** - it demonstrates system switching
- **Edit timings** to match your song structure
- **Keep audio reactivity** - it's what makes it alive
- **System switches** should match song intensity changes
- **Export often** - save your work as you go

### Creative Ideas:
- **Intro**: Faceted smooth (build anticipation)
- **Verse**: Faceted cycle (rhythmic patterns)
- **Build-up**: Accelerate rotation (tension)
- **Drop**: Switch to Quantum chaos (impact)
- **Peak**: Switch to Holographic (maximum energy)
- **Breakdown**: Back to Faceted minimal (breathing space)
- **Outro**: Quantum extreme (grand finale)

## What Makes This Special

**Traditional choreography**: Fixed, no audio response
**Pure reactive**: No control over timing
**THIS SYSTEM**: Best of both worlds!

You get:
‚úÖ Precise timing control (choreography)
‚úÖ Live audio reactivity (built-in)
‚úÖ System switching (choreography)
‚úÖ Dynamic parameters (audio modulation)
‚úÖ Repeatable sequences (save/load)
‚úÖ Impossible-to-perform-live complexity

---

**Test it now**: Load your audio file and watch the default choreography demonstrate system switching at 30s, 50s, 60s, and 75s while the audio reactivity pulses everything in real-time!
